# Welcome to the 5C Hackathon! 🚀

This year’s theme is **CODE TO CONNECT**, and we want to empower you to build projects that engage meaningfully with the community around us — the Claremont Colleges.

## 📊 About the Datasets

The datasets in this repository were generously provided by the **Pomona** and **Scripps Sustainability Offices**. They reflect real aspects of campus life and sustainability efforts.

Whether you're looking to:
- Clean and analyze real-world data,
- Create beautiful, insightful visualizations,
- Or build tools that help students, staff, or the planet...

You're in the right place.

## 🛠️ How to Use

These datasets are yours to explore — dig into campus trends, ask big questions, or just have fun experimenting with data!

- Smaller files can be viewed directly on GitHub.
- Larger files will need to be downloaded to your device. (Heads up: check the file sizes before downloading — especially if your laptop is running low on storage or battery!)

We can’t wait to see what you build.
